A simple LCD screen game where you jump over hills and duck under crows with buttons.

Enjoy this Hillrun game!
Jump over hills by pressing jump, and duck  under crows by holding duck.
DON'T CRASH! If you die, press jump to continue.
Score  = crows ducked under + hills jumped over

I am only 12 years old and mostly an amateur at Arduino. 
After  reading some project hub projects and learning Arduino,
I was inspired to create  this fun game. It did not take too much debugging and is really cool. 
The code  is pretty clean by my standards. ENJOY!! Please respect and comment.

Remember  to download the libraries included in this program and put them in the directory  folder. If there is an error that it cannot find the library, then just use sketch>include  library. Comment if you have any problems.
Libraries at https://github.com/PunkyMunky64/HillRun2Libraries

IF  YOU WANT TO USE AN UNO INSTEAD: in the code change const int DUCK_PIN to 3. 
and  rewire the duck button from pin 18 to digital pin 3.
